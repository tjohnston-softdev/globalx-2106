*Homer begins his first day of work at the Globex Corporation. He is being given a tour of the office by the company's CEO, Hank Scorpio**

**Scorpio:** You will notice, my new best friend, that we are pretty casual around here.

**Homer:** (Montone) Yes, sir. I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion.

**Scorpio:** Don't call me "Mr. Scorpion." It's "Mr. Scorpi**o**," but don't call me that either. Call me Hank!

**Scorpio:** Uh say, before we continue our tour, would you mind hanging my coat up on the wall, please? (Unzipping his coat and giving it to Homer)

**Homer:** Mhm

*Homer looks around the open plan office for a place to hang the coat. The entire area is surrounded by windows. Homer is confused and unable to find a suitable place to hang the coat.*

**Scorpio:** (Laughing) Relax, Homer! At Globex, we don't believe in walls. Matter of fact, I didn't even give you my coat!

*Homer perplexingly checks his hands only to find that the coat has vanished from his grip and reappeared on Scorpio, albeit backwards, looking like a turtleneck. Scorpio has a wide grin on his face and Homer is genuinely impressed by this 'magic trick'*

**Homer:** Wow...

*This was actually one of my favourite episodes growing up, like, I'm not even kidding.*
